# HYPERCLOCKED-ModChart
This is my Beat Saber Hyperclocked stuff.

Someone wanted me to make this open-sourced, which is why this exists now

I'm probably the worst person to learn from (especially because this is my FIRST unity project (AND because I'm a dumbass whose iq is the temperature of my room)), and my JS script and Unity project are SUPER SUPER SUPER messy, So uh, good luck.
