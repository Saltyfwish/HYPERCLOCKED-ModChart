# HYPERCLOCKED-ModChart
This is my Beat Saber Hyperclocked stuff.
Someone wanted me to make this open-sourced, which is why this exists now
I'm probably the worst person to learn from (especially because this is my FIRST unity project), and my JS script and Unity project are SUPER SUPER SUPER messy, So uh, good luck.
